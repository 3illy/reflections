Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: If I was colaberating on a project with multiple developers I would definetly want to have a remote repository so that we would not all need to be in the same place to work on the same project, or rather that we could share and update files without having to be in the same place when we do so.  This also allows me to work on the project from multiple locations as well as having the safety of redundant coppies on muultiple machines.
